    "abstract": "This paper proposes new approaches to rank individuals from their\ngroup comparison results. Many real-world problems are of this\ntype. For example, ranking players from team comparisons is important\nin some sports.  In machine learning, a closely related application is\nclassification using coding matrices. Group comparison results are\nusually in two types: binary indicator outcomes (wins/losses) or\nmeasured outcomes (scores).  For each type of results, we propose new\nmodels for estimating individuals' abilities, and hence a ranking of\nindividuals. The estimation is carried out by solving convex\nminimization problems, for which we develop easy and efficient\nsolution procedures. Experiments on real bridge records and\nmulti-class classification demonstrate the viability of the proposed\nmodels.",

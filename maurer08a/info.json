    "abstract": "A method is introduced to learn and represent similarity with linear\noperators in kernel induced Hilbert spaces. Transferring error bounds for\nvector valued large-margin classifiers to the setting of Hilbert-Schmidt\noperators leads to dimension free bounds on a risk functional for linear\nrepresentations and motivates a regularized objective functional.\nMinimization of this objective is effected by a simple technique of\nstochastic gradient descent. The resulting representations are tested on\ntransfer problems in image processing, involving plane and spatial geometric\ninvariants, handwritten characters and face recognition.",

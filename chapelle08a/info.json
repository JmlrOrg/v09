    "abstract": "Due to its wide applicability, the problem of semi-supervised\nclassification is attracting increasing attention in machine learning.\nSemi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (S<sup>3</sup>VMs) are based on applying\nthe margin maximization principle to both labeled and unlabeled\nexamples.  Unlike SVMs, their formulation leads to a non-convex\noptimization problem.  A suite of algorithms have recently been\nproposed for solving S<sup>3</sup>VMs.  This paper reviews key ideas in this\nliterature. The performance and behavior of various S<sup>3</sup>VMs algorithms\nis studied together, under a common experimental setting.",

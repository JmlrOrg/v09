    "abstract": "In the last years of his life, Leo Breiman promoted random forests for\nuse in classification. He suggested using averaging as a means of\nobtaining good discrimination rules.  The base classifiers used for\naveraging are simple and randomized, often based on random samples\nfrom the data.  He left a few questions unanswered regarding the\nconsistency of such rules. In this paper, we give a number of theorems\nthat establish the universal consistency of averaging rules. We also\nshow that some popular classifiers, including one suggested by\nBreiman, are not universally consistent.",

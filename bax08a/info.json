    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new PAC transductive error bound for\nclassification. The method uses information from the training examples\nand inputs of working examples to develop a set of likely assignments\nto outputs of the working examples. A likely assignment with maximum\nerror determines the bound. The method is very effective for small\ndata sets.",

    "abstract": "Statistical models on full and partial rankings of <i>n</i> items are\noften of limited practical use for large <i>n</i> due to computational\nconsideration. We explore the use of non-parametric models for\npartially ranked data and derive computationally efficient\nprocedures for their use for large <i>n</i>. The derivations are\nlargely possible through combinatorial and algebraic manipulations\nbased on the lattice of partial rankings. A bias-variance analysis\nand an experimental study demonstrate the applicability of the\nproposed method.",

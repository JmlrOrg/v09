    "abstract": "Loog (2007) provided a complete characterization of the\nfamily of solutions to a generalized <i>Fisher</i> criterion. We show\nthat this characterization is essentially equivalent to the original\ncharacterization proposed in Ye (2005). The computational\nadvantage of the original characterization over the new one is\ndiscussed, which justifies its practical use.",

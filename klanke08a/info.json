    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce an improved implementation of locally weighted\nprojection regression (LWPR), a supervised learning algorithm that is\ncapable of handling high-dimensional input data. As the key features,\nour code supports multi-threading, is available for multiple\nplatforms, and provides wrappers for several programming languages.",
